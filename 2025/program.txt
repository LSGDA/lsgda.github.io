Put differently, if harnessed properly, data holds the potential to enable value creation throughout society.
  Considering primarily vehicle trajectory data in the context of road networks, this talk puts focus on transportation analytics: While we all depend on it for mobility, transportation has adverse effects on our productivity due to lack of predictability and congestion, on the climate due to greenhouse gas emissions, and our health and safety due to air and noise pollution and accidents. In sum, it makes sense to invent techniques capable of leveraging road networks and trajectory data to improve transportation.
  This talk describes how the availability of massive trajectory data renders the traditional routing paradigm, where a road network is modeled as an edge-weighted graph, inadequate. Instead, new paradigms that thrive on massive trajectory data are called for. The talk covers several such paradigms. As even massive volumes of trajectory data are sparse in these settings, the talk also covers means of making good use of available data.9:T52c,Modern graph-parallel systems are overwhelmingly designed for vertex-centric iterative computation (e.g., Pregel-style models), which excel at basic tasks like random walks and traversals but fail to support advanced structural analytics algorithms — such as dense subgraph mining, frequent pattern mining, and subgraph enumeration/matching — despite their proven value and transformative potential in real-world applications. Even today’s mainstream graph databases, through their "Graph Data Science" (GDS) libraries, limit support to vertex-centric primitives, ignoring decades of research on structural analytics from the database, data mining, and AI communities. This gap leaves a wealth of analytical potential untapped in real-world systems.

In this talk, I will introduce T-thinker, a novel "think-like-a-task" paradigm designed to parallelize backtracking search algorithms for structural analytics. I will showcase systems built on T-thinker that support multi-core CPU parallelism, multi-GPU acceleration, and distributed computing. Looking forward, I will outline a vision for integrating structural analytics primitives as native operations in graph databases, to unlock their full potential for graph-powered analytics and AI — bridging the divide between academic innovation and industrial adoption.0:["ft-OZ2srohf3_e_zuSLjK",[[["",{"children":["program",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["program",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",[["$","header",null,{"className":"mb-6 bg-primary","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-[70em] h-[4em] mx-auto flex justify-between pr-3.5 pl-5 md:pl-8 lg:pl-10","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"py-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold block text-white","children":"LSGDA 2025"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-black font-semibold block text-xs mt-[-0.2em]","children":"London UK"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex text-gray-100","children":["$","$L2",null,{}]}]]}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"max-w-[70em] w-full min-h-[500px] mx-auto relative px-5 md:px-8 lg:px-10","children":[["$","h2",null,{"children":"keynote SPEAKERS"}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","div","0",{"className":"my-4","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center space-x-4","children":[["$","$L3",null,{"src":"images/speakers/tamer.jpg","alt":"M.

As data volume and complexity grew, we introduced BG3 (ByteGraph 3.0)—a cost-effective and scalable system featuring: (1) a query-efficient storage engine using BW-tree indices and cloud storage, (2) workload-aware space reclamation for better storage utilization, and (3) a lightweight synchronization mechanism for real-time consistency. BG3 significantly reduces operational costs while supporting fast, large-scale graph processing across ByteDance`s global platforms."}]]}]]}]]}]]}],["$","tr","1",{"className":"border-b","children":[["$","td",null,{"className":"p-4 whitespace-nowrap","children":"14:20-15:00"}],["$","td",null,{"children":[["$","strong",null,{"className":"block text-xl my-2","children":"Parallel Graph Structural Analytics: Systems and Visions for Next-Generation Graph Data Science"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mx-2 my-2","children":"Prof. Da Yan (Indiana University Bloomington)"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex space-x-4","children":[["$","strong",null,{"children":["$","p",null,{"className":"mx-2 my-5 inline-block rounded-full border px-4 py-1 text-sm font-medium bg-blue-100 border-blue-400 text-blue-800","children":"Keynote Talk 4"}]}],["$","$L5",null,{"children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"underline cursor-pointer","children":"Abstract"}],["$","$L7",null,{"children":"$9"}]]}]]}]]}]]}],["$","tr","2",{"className":"border-b","children":[["$","td",null,{"className":"p-4 whitespace-nowrap","children":"15:00-15:30"}],["$","td",null,{"children":[["$","strong",null,{"className":"block text-xl my-10","children":"Afternoon Break"}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"flex space-x-4","children":[["$","strong",null,{"children":"$undefined"}],"$undefined"]}]]}]]}],["$","tr","3",{"className":"border-b","children":[["$","td",null,{"className":"p-4 whitespace-nowrap","children":"15:30-15:45"}],["$","td",null,{"children":[["$","strong",null,{"className":"block text-xl my-2","children":"Semantic Embedding for Enterprise Clustering: A Systematic and Scalable Approach Using Sentence Transformers"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mx-2 my-2","children":"Yigong Xiao, Xianzhi Lei, Kecheng Wang, Changan Zhou, Niannian Huang (Zhejiang Venus Intelligence Technology Co., Ltd.; Shenzhen Jiuxin Software Co., Ltd.)"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex space-x-4","children":[["$","strong",null,{"children":["$","p",null,{"className":"mx-2 my-5 inline-block rounded-full border px-4 py-1 text-sm font-medium bg-yellow-100 border-yellow-400 text-yellow-800","children":"Paper Presentations 7"}]}],"$undefined"]}]]}]]}],["$","tr","4",{"className":"border-b","children":[["$","td",null,{"className":"p-4 whitespace-nowrap","children":"15:45-16:00"}],["$","td",null,{"children":[["$","strong",null,{"className":"block text-xl my-2","children":"Shape-Aware, Scale-Agnostic Representation of Dynamic DAGs"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mx-2 my-2","children":"Jennifer Neumann, Peter M.
